## What Was Implemented

### 1. New File: `financial-profile.js`
**Location:** `/public/dashboard/financial-profile.js`

This module handles all the logic for displaying the user's financial profile:

#### Key Features:
- **Identity Blurb Generation**: Creates a personalized summary describing the user's employment situation
- **Completion Tracking**: Shows profile completion percentage with visual progress bar
- **Smart Insights**: Generates insights across three categories:
  - **Income Steadiness**: Employment type, tenure, industry outlook, regional unemployment
  - **Momentum & Opportunity**: Promotion likelihood, upskilling progress, skill demand, role satisfaction
  - **Safety Nets**: Emergency fund coverage, income protection, savings rate

#### Data Structure:
The module reads from the Firestore path: `users/{uid}/income/profile`
- Syncs automatically with the Income Profile wizard
- Listens for the `income-profile:updated` event to refresh in real-time

### 2. Updated: `dashboard.css`
**Location:** `/public/dashboard/dashboard.css`

Added comprehensive styling for the profile launch card:
- Gradient background with neon accent
- Hover effects and animations
- Responsive design for mobile
- Launch button with elevated shadow effects

### 3. Existing File: `financial-profile.html`
**Location:** `/public/dashboard/financial-profile.html`

The HTML structure was already in place and includes:
- Hero section with identity blurb and launch button
- Summary cards grid (4 cards: Completeness, Stability, Opportunity, Safety)
- Detailed sections with expandable profile data
- Empty state when no profile exists

## User Experience Flow

### Initial State (No Profile Data)
1. User sees an empty state with a call-to-action
2. Prompt to complete the Income Profile wizard
3. Launch button opens the wizard modal

### With Profile Data
1. **Identity Blurb**: Personalized description at the top
   - Example: "You work as a Senior Product Designer at Vibance Labs with 2 years and 4 months in your current role."

2. **Summary Cards**:
   - **Completeness Card**: Shows % complete with progress bar
   - **Stability Card**: Lists factors like employment type, tenure, industry outlook
   - **Opportunity Card**: Displays promotion odds, skill demand, satisfaction
   - **Safety Card**: Shows emergency fund, income protection coverage

3. **Detailed Sections**: Expandable cards showing:
   - Work Overview (role, company, tenure)
   - Stability Factors (industry, location, layoff history)
   - Income Reliability (variable pay, savings rate, coverage)
   - Growth & Opportunity (promotion pipeline, upskilling, skill demand)
   - Safety Net (emergency fund, major expenses)
   - Additional Context (user notes)

### Real-Time Updates
- When user updates their Income Profile, the Financial Profile page automatically refreshes
- Visual feedback with completion percentage updates
- Insights dynamically adjust based on new data

## Data Mapping Examples

### Employment Type → Stability Signal
- W-2, Salaried, Full-time → High stability (✓)
- Contract, Freelance, Gig → Moderate stability (•)

### Promotion Pipeline
- 70%+ → "Strong promotion odds" (high, ↑)
- 40-69% → "Moderate promotion chance" (moderate, •)
- <40% → "Low promotion likelihood" (low, •)

### Emergency Fund
- 6+ months → "Strong emergency fund" (high, ✓)
- 3-5 months → "Emergency cushion" (moderate, •)
- 0-2 months → "Limited emergency fund" (low, ⚠)

## Color Coding System
- **High/Positive**: Neon green (#CCFF00) with ✓ or ↑
- **Moderate/Neutral**: Neutral gray with •
- **Low/Warning**: Orange with ⚠

## Technical Details

### Event Communication
- Income Profile wizard fires: `income-profile:updated`
- Financial Profile listens and reloads data automatically

## Security & Privacy
